Introduction/Project Description:
The game of basketball has evolved. This AISC Winter project investigates how changes to NBA court geometry can be used to counter modern three-point inflation and restore stylistic balance in professional basketball. Using historical NBA shot-tracking and player performance data, the project builds artificial intelligence simulations and machine-learning probability models to estimate shot difficulty and shot selection as functions of court dimensions, player skill, and game context. By simulating counterfactual court designs—such as extending the three-point arc or widening the baselines—the system evaluates how teams would adapt their offensive strategies under new spatial constraints. Optimization techniques are then applied to identify “ideal” court dimensions that reduce low-efficiency three-point attempts, where the pure, skilled shooters will preserve their elite shooting advantages. Big man interior and post-oriented play will then be viable again as the three pointer will be a more difficult shot. As the perimeter increases, defenses will have to adapt to new offensive play styles with coverages the NBA has yet to see. The result is a data-driven framework for rule and court design that promotes strategic diversity, competitive balance, and a more varied on-court product without fundamentally altering the spirit of the game.
